FINAL PROJECT: NYU-6463 PROCESSOR
NYU-6463 Processor Design
For the final project, you will implement a 32-bit processor in VHDL, called NYU-6463
Processor, which is capable of executing programs. The processor supports the instruction set
specified in the next section.
Design Specification
Instructions
Every instruction has 32 bits that define the type of instruction as well as the operands and the
destination of the result. The NYU-6463 Processor has three instruction types: (a) R-Type for
arithmetic instructions, (b) I-Type for immediate value operations, load and store instructions,
and (c) J-Type for jump instructions.
